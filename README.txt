# MOVED TO GITLAB
FCUK MICROSOFT, i migrated all my repos to www.gitlab.com/atesin soon i will delete all these (ironically, GIT was invented by linus torvalds)

HTTPy: Console based HTTP server for python 3
Requires Ncat to function online (https://nmap.org/ncat)
Type "httpy.py -h" for more details

httpy just takes HTTP requests from standard input and writes responses to
standard output and logs to standard error

httpy is licensed under WTFPL and published without any warranty, i wrote it
just to learn python in a fun way so it may contain errors, now you are adviced
you are the solely responsible for running it and its consequences

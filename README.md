httpy just take HTTP requests from standard input and writes the response to
standard output, so it requires ncat as external program to function online,
logs (access, error, etc.) goes to stderr

httpy is licensed under WTFPL, it is written by atesin%gmail,com just to learn
python so it may contain errors, so you are solely responsible for running it
and its consequences
